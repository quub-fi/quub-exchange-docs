- **Transaction security**: Multi-signature and timelock protections
- **Oracle security**: Secure price feed and data oracles

## 🚀 Key Features

### Multi-chain Support
- **Ethereum integration**: Full Ethereum and EVM compatibility
- **Layer 2 solutions**: Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism support
- **Alternative chains**: Solana, Avalanche, and other blockchain support
- **Cross-chain protocols**: Bridge and interoperability solutions

### Smart Contract Services
- **Contract deployment**: Automated contract deployment and management
- **Proxy patterns**: Upgradeable contract implementations
- **Event monitoring**: Real-time blockchain event monitoring
- **Gas optimization**: Transaction cost optimization strategies

## �� API Reference

Blockchain operations are defined in:
- [`chain.yaml`](../../openapi/chain.yaml) - Complete API specification
