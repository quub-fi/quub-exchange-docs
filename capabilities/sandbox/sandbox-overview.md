# Development Sandbox

This directory contains documentation for development sandbox environments including testing frameworks, simulation tools, and development utilities.

## 📋 Overview

The Sandbox service provides comprehensive development and testing environments, featuring isolated sandbox instances, testing frameworks, and simulation tools for safe development and experimentation.

## 📁 Documentation Structure

### Sandbox Environments
- *[Isolated development environments to be documented]*
- *[Data isolation and environment management]*
- *[Configuration and deployment automation]*

### Testing Frameworks
- *[Automated testing and validation frameworks]*
- *[Load testing and performance simulation]*
- *[Integration testing and contract validation]*

### Simulation Tools
- *[Market simulation and backtesting]*
- *[Scenario testing and stress simulation]*
- *[Data generation and mock services]*

## 🔐 Sandbox Security

Sandbox operations ensure secure development:
- **Environment isolation**: Complete sandbox isolation from production
- **Data protection**: Synthetic data and privacy protection
- **Access controls**: Developer access management and permissions
- **Resource limits**: Sandbox resource quotas and limitations

## 🚀 Key Features

### Development Support
- **Rapid provisioning**: Quick sandbox environment creation
- **Configuration management**: Environment configuration and templates
- **Version control**: Environment versioning and rollback
- **Collaboration tools**: Multi-developer sandbox support

### Testing Capabilities
- **Automated testing**: Comprehensive test automation frameworks
- **Performance testing**: Load and stress testing capabilities
- **API testing**: RESTful and GraphQL API testing tools
- **Contract testing**: API contract validation and compatibility

## 📊 API Reference

Sandbox operations are defined in:
- [`sandbox.yaml`](../../openapi/sandbox.yaml) - Complete API specification

## 🧪 Coming Soon

- Sandbox architecture diagrams
- Testing framework documentation
- Environment provisioning guides
- Simulation tool specifications


*Comprehensive development sandbox with testing frameworks and simulation capabilities.*
